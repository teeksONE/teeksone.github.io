    <span class="mindset">Sober Mindset</span>
    <p>While the last drink may feel like an improbable future, in reality it could be the beginning of something you couldn't even dream of.
        Sobriety doesnt mean you'll never have fun again, it just means you'll be present when you do.
        While right now it might seem impossible, but its not. People in far worse situations than yours have managed to change their lives forever.
        I believe you can be one of those people, why else would you be here? Don't let me fool you, its not going to be easy.
        But how easy is the life you're currently living? Compared to that unmanageable mayhem, sobriety should be easy. 
        With the right programme, support and strategies you make the first steps to a new life.</p>

            <li>Building New Habits & A New Life</li>

<!--first and most imoportant step-->
<div>
            <h3>Acknowledging You Have A Problem</h3>

            <p>It may seem obvious, but this is the most important step. You need to be honest with yourself and admit that you have a problem with alcohol.
                This can be difficult, but it's essential if you want to make a change. You can do this by writing down your thoughts and feelings about your drinking.
                You can also talk to someone you trust about your struggles.</p>

<!--Second major step-->

            <h3>Seek Support</h3>
            <p>Once you've acknowledged that you have a problem, it's time to seek support. This can come in many forms, such as therapy, support groups, or even just talking to friends and family.
                The important thing is to find a support system that works for you. You don't have to go through this alone.</p>

<!-- third major step-->

            <h3>Building New Habits & a New Life</h3>
            <p>Once you've acknowledged that you have a problem and sought support, it's time to start building new habits and a new life. This can be difficult, but it's essential if you want to stay sober.
                Start by setting small goals for yourself, such as going a week without drinking or finding a new hobby. As you achieve these goals, you'll start to feel more confident in your ability to stay sober.</p>

<div>
    <button class="AA">Find a Meeting</button> 
    <button class="NA">Find a Meeting</button>
    <button class="SA">Find a Meeting</button>

    <p>If you've just found yourself trying to get sober or trying to abstain I woould always suggest attending a meeting. If you dont know if youve got a problem or your unsure, thats fine. 
        But attend a meeting and listen. Take what you find useful and leave the rest. Just remember, your subconcious doens't want to be there right now. Right now it doesn't want to be sober.
        Thats ok, it was the same for me and its the same for the next person. But what do you want to do, drink use drugs or build a better future, becasue thats possible.</p>
